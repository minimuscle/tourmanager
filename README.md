# Tour Manager

This is an RMIT University Project using ReactJs, NodeJS - Express, and Java

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install dependencies.

```bash
cd tm-frontend
npm install
# This will install the front-end dependencies

cd api
npm install
# This will install the dependencies needed for the API
```

## Usage

To run the software, both the ReactJS and NodeJS servers need to be running. To run both at the same time, use the following:

```bash
cd tm-frontend
npm run api
```

To run these separately:

```bash
cd tm-frontend
npm start
# Runs "react-scripts start"

cd api
nodemon
# This runs the node.js server on nodemon, which allows dynamic changes to the code.
```
